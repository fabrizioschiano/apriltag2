# AprilTag is a visual fiducial system, useful for a wide variety of tasks including augmented reality, robotics, and camera calibration. Targets can be created from an ordinary printer, and the AprilTag detection software computes the precise 3D position, orientation, and identity of the tags relative to the camera. Implementations are available in Java, as well as in C. Notably, the C implementation has no external dependencies and is designed to be easily included in other applications, as well as portable to embedded devices. Real-time performance can be achieved even on cell-phone grade processors.
